Cherokee White Eagle corn and a new gifted sacred chinmark flour corn from the Hopi gifted to me from a seed saver out West. By far two of the prettiest color combinations I’ve ever seen. Excited to grow these especially the Hopi since it did well for them out West unusual for a southwestern desert variety. #seedstarting #seed #gardening #garden #vegetarian #vegetablegarden #vegetables #corn #maize #horticulture #agriculture,"{""1"": {""comment_id"": ""maizemagician""  ""comment_text"": ""Cherokee White Eagle corn and a new gifted sacred chinmark flour corn from the Hopi gifted to me from a seed saver out West.

More glorious organically grown Glass Gem Corn cobs fresh off the plants.🌈This bunch really do look like jellybeans!! 💜💙💚💛🧡❤To get the most colour out of your cobs you need to leave them on the plants until the husks are brown and dried (the texture of a paperbag).If you do need to harvest earlier then at least waiting for the husk to turn beige before you harvest is ideal.To ripen your crop faster once the tassels are dried up and no longer producing any pollen you can remove a fair amount of the foliage this will increase airflow and sunlight and can help the cobs mature faster. 🌱,"{""1"": {""comment_id"": ""buttenshawbackyardfarm""  ""comment_text"": ""More glorious organically grown Glass Gem Corn cobs fresh off the plants.🌈\nThis bunch really do look like jellybeans!! 💜💙💚💛🧡❤\nTo get the most colour out of your cobs  you need to leave them on the plants until the husks are brown and dried (the texture of a paperbag).\nIf you do need to harvest earlier  then at least waiting for the husk to turn beige before you harvest is ideal.\nTo ripen your crop faster  once the tassels are dried up and no longer producing any pollen  you can remove a fair amount of the foliage  this will increase airflow and sunlight and can help the cobs mature faster. 🌱""}  ""2"": {""comment_id"": ""buttenshawbackyardfarm""  ""comment_text"": ""@dannydigby""}  ""3"": {""comment_id"": ""isasaskia""  ""comment_text"": ""@oliviaobrien""}  ""4"": {""comment_id"": ""camille.kamaaina""  ""comment_text"": ""😍""}  ""5"": {""comment_id"": ""theflowerpot.ct""  ""comment_text"": ""🔥🔥🔥""}  ""6"": {""comment_id"": ""dvoretskaia5257""  ""comment_text"": ""Incredible""}  ""7"": {""comment_id"": ""pseudologuelog""  ""comment_text"": ""I love glass corn content!!""}  ""8"": {""comment_id"": ""karinaglasgow""  ""comment_text"": ""I really appreciate your growing tips.
